# UX Research Notes

- Log opt-in usage locally (hotkeys, actions, drop-off points).
- Capture friction summaries after playtests (bronze–diamond focus).
- Questions to probe:
  - Where do players lose pace (timer drift, step confusion)?
  - When do they pause/disable voice or close overlay?
  - Which toggles/features go unused?
- Summaries belong here; avoid collecting personal data.
